# Tic-Tac-Toe
## Created by Gavin Uhran

### Description
A fun recreation of the popular game "Tic-Tac-Toe". The game is made for a single player, who faces against an algorithm that responds to the user's moves. The program is coded in **Python**, utilizing the **Pygame** library.

### How it Works
![Start Menu](https://i.imgur.com/XNFt3eW.jpg)</br>
First, the program opens up a UI window, powered by **Pygame**. The window first displays the start menu, seen above. Clicking on the "start" button begins the game.

In game, the user will see a 3x3 board, initially empty. Clicking on any open square will place your 'X'. In return, the program strategically places an 'O' in an open square. Either you or the program placing three of your own symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, wins the game. If all the board has no open squares and no one has won, the match results in a draw.

When the game is finished, the display changes to show the results of the match, then allow the user to replay, or close the window, killing the program.

### Future Improvements
Currently, the program's algorithm is built in a way that makes it impossible for the user to win. The program can only win or create a draw with the user. Although, it is spectacular to see my algorithm work, I can imagine it is also not a great user experience. In the future, I would like to add algorithms of lesser difficulty for the user, and allow the user to select which algorithm they play against.
